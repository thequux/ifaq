Hi guys, I have a question about shells, because I am studying them right
now.

There are three types of shells

. C and TC shell
. Bash
. Korn Shell

I know Bash is pretty popular, but did you get to use other ones? If so,
where?

Thanks +

A bit of a history lesson:

In the beginning, there was a shell called the "operator shell".  It
wasn't called that at the time, mind you; it was just called the
"shell" because there was nothing else to confuse it with.  This shell
was a very simple wrapper around fork and exec, and was not a
particularly friendly shell for scripting.  Another person, this time
named Stephen Bourne, decided to fix this, and wrote his own shell,
the "bourne shell".  Because the operator shell was already installed
as /bin/osh, Bourne decided that the only logical name for HIS shell
was /bin/sh.  Now that there was a shell that was good for scripting,
everybody started using it for scripting, and so it became difficult
to modify for fear of compatibility problems.  So, a man named David
Korn decided that the best solution was to write his own shell, and
install it as /bin/ksh.  While the Korn shell worked, and was quite
nice for interactive use, featuring such wonderful features as command
line editing, it was a royal pain in the ass for scripting.

Meanwhile, off in another part of the world, a couple of hackers at
Berkeley decided that C was a rather nice language, and wouldn't it be
nice to write scripts in a c-like syntax?  And so the C shell was
born, introducing magical new features like command history.  Writing
shell scripts in C syntax turned out to be extremely ill-advised, but
there were already users, and some of them though that they liked it
so much that they wrote the Tenex C shell, which introduced command
completion, among other things.  While for a while it was the best
interactive shell around (for a while at least), it was the only thing
worse than csh for scripting.

We shall now venture off to Boston, where a http://stallman.org[hacker
with a very large beard] and even larger plan for world domination
decided that the best way to solve the UNIX fragmentation problem that
was popping up was to create his own unix, and release it for
free.  (He was somewhat confused about the meaning of the word free,
and decided that it meant "open source").  Unfortunately, all of the
above shells were copyright AT&T and/or Berkeley, so he decided to
make a copy of the Bourne shell, and called it the "Bourne Again
shell", or "bash".  This was just the first of a line of Really Bad
Puns (TM). Compared to everything else out there, bash was really
nice: it had sane evaluation semantics, completion, command history,
command line editing, and many more of the things that most people
seem to expect out of a shell.  So, it became immensely popular, and
often is installed as /bin/sh by people who did not understand that
the Bourne shell was a very different shell indeed.

The world became stable for a while, and shells stopped randomly
popping into existence (or at least, gaining traction when they did).
Until, of course, somebody decided that bash didn't have enough
features, wrote a patch to add some, and then realized that his patch
did not actually use any of the bash code and so it became known as
the z shell, "z" standing for nothing in particular.  It has more
features than Emacs, and even includes an FTP client as an example
shell script.  It tends to be used by insufferable elitist clods like
myself who feel that ZSH is the one true shell; nothing else competes
with it and you're an idiot if you don't use it.

There are two other shells that you should know about: http://ipython.scipy.org[IPython] and
Zoidberg.  Zoidberg is built around the idea that perl is the duct tape
that holds UNIX together, and wouldn't it be nice to use
interactively?  IPython is the same idea, but with python and somewhat
less shell-like default behavior.
